# Pyne Decision Tree Librairy

The Pyne decision tree librairy is still very young. I wrote it in a moment of inspiration while studying with Prof. Angelos Georghiou. We had a bit of fun and I hope I can put my head to it someday soon.

I put it online after someone asked to give it a spin. If you are familiar with Jupyter, I suggest that you start by looking at the examples in the pyne folder. If you are not familiar with Jupyter, I suggest you go learn about this amazing tool as soon as you can.

I do commit to making this repository better and adding a bit more documentation, but it might take a while until it actually happens. Until then, don't hesitate to send me an email for questions, suggestions or anything else: francois.trahan@gmail.com

Have fun!
